Technical Product Manager - Strategic Finance
\
New York, NY
Concourse (http://www.concourse.co/)&nbsp;is building AI agents for corporate finance teams. We have been building at the intersection of finance and AI for the last 2 years and have grown significantly since our launch a few months ago. Concourse customers now include public companies as well as high-growth startups from Persona, Instabase, Lightmatter, and more. Concourse is backed by top-tier Silicon Valley Investors Andreessen Horowitz, CRV, Box Group, YC.\
\
As growth continues to accelerate, we're seeking an exceptional Growth Product Manager to own customer activation, expansion, and relationships in the finance domain. This role combines strategic product thinking with hands-on technical execution and is our first non-engineering role at Concourse.
The Role
This is a high-impact product role where you'll own the entire customer growth engine for finance teams. You'll be the architect of customer success, combining deep finance domain expertise with analytical rigor to drive activation, expansion, and retention. You'll work directly with our founders, technical team, and work on solving complex technical problems that directly impact our customers and drive their success.
This isn't traditional product management - you'll be in the trenches with customers, debugging AI outputs, architecting data solutions, and building the frameworks that turn finance teams into power users of AI. You will use this knowledge to help inform the product roadmap and work with the entire team to continue creating customer success.
Key Responsibilities
Product Strategy &amp; Execution
Own the customer growth product roadmap - from onboarding flows to advanced analytics features
Design and optimize the customer journey to drive faster activation and deeper product adoption
Build scalable frameworks for customer segmentation, health scoring, and expansion opportunities
Partner closely with engineering to prioritize features that drive measurable growth outcomes
Technical Problem Solving &amp; Data Science
Debug and resolve complex AI outputs (Python, SQL, and more), data integration issues, and system connectivity problems
Architect solutions for ERPs, banks, CRMs, HRIS systems, and custom database integrations
Build and maintain sophisticated prompt libraries and AI model configurations for finance use cases
Collaborate with engineering teams to optimize query performance and data pipeline reliability
Customer Relationships &amp; Growth
Develop advanced analytics to understand customer behavior, usage patterns, and expansion signals
Build predictive models to identify at-risk accounts and high-potential growth opportunities
Create comprehensive reporting dashboards for customer health, feature adoption, and revenue metrics
Conduct deep-dive analyses to inform product strategy and customer success tactics
About You
Finance Domain Mastery
2+ years in strategic finance, or finance operations with deep systems expertise
Expert-level understanding of financial statements, accounting, and finance operations
Extensive experience with enterprise finance systems (NetSuite, Sage Intacct, Oracle, SAP, Salesforce, etc.)
Track record of optimizing finance workflows and implementing system improvements
Advanced Technical &amp; Analytical Skills
Highly proficient in SQL - can write complex queries, optimize performance, and debug integration issues
Strong experience with Python, R, or similar for data analysis and automation
Proven collaboration with data engineering and analytics teams on large-scale projects
Familiarity with business intelligence tools (Tableau, Looker, PowerBI), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres) and data modeling
Product &amp; Growth Startup Mindset
Strong analytical framework for measuring and optimizing success metrics
Ability to translate customer feedback into product requirements and feature prioritization
Track record of building 0-1 processes and scaling them efficiently
Entrepreneurial mindset with the ability to operate autonomously in ambiguous environments
Exceptional communication skills and ability to build relationships with C-level finance executives
Understanding of SaaS growth metrics, cohort analysis, and customer lifecycle management
Bonus Points
Experience at fintech, data infrastructure, or enterprise companies
Experience building or significantly improving customer onboarding, activation, or expansion processes
Worked directly with data science/engineering teams on customer-facing analytics
Experience with prompt engineering, LLMs, or AI/ML model optimization
What we offer
Top-of-the-market compensation. We offer top-of-the-market compensation in both cash and equity. We want to stay lean and mean with a world class team and will compensate as such.
Continuous Learning. Every day will be a new opportunity to learn and expand your skill set. We are focused on increasing the pace of learning for everyone at the company. If you are continuously curious and focused on improving your skills &amp; domain expertise at work, Concourse will be a great fit for you.
Ownership &amp; High Impact. As an early team member, we will look to you to directly own parts of the product, customer base, and culture of the company. You will have the opportunity to build the playbook for AI adoption in enterprise finance.

We want to stay lean and mean with a world class team and will compensate as such.\r\n\r\n**Continuous Learning.** Every day will be a new opportunity to learn and expand your skill set. We are focused on increasing the pace of learning for everyone at the company. If you are continuously curious and focused on improving your skills \u0026 domain expertise at work, Concourse will be a great fit for you.\r\n\r\n**Ownership \u0026 High Impact.** As an early team member, we will look to you to directly own parts of the product, customer base, and culture of the company.

New York, NY</p>
<p><a href="http://www.concourse.co/" target="_blank">Concourse</a>&nbsp;is building AI agents for corporate finance teams.

<li>Highly proficient in SQL - can write complex queries, optimize performance, and debug integration issues</li>
<li>Strong experience with Python, R, or similar for data analysis and automation</li>
<li>Proven collaboration with data engineering and analytics teams on large-scale projects</li>
<li>Familiarity with business intelligence tools (Tableau, Looker, PowerBI), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres) and data modeling</li>
