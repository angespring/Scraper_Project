Today, insights live in many places and leaders often have to stitch together views of performance, markets, and risk on their own. You'll change this by building clear, executive-ready analytics that connect operational data to business outcomes and long-term strategy. Your focus will be on designing sophisticated analytical frameworks, elevating how we measure the business, and turning complex data into simple, actionable recommendations for our CFO, VP Finance, FP&amp;A team, and other senior leaders. You'll report to the VP Finance and operate as a team leader, building and leading a small, high-performing Business Analytics &amp; Insights team while staying hands-on across SQL, statistical analysis, and data visualization. In your first year, you'll establish the core set of executive dashboards, strategic KPIs, and analytic tools that GitLab's leadership will rely on to run the company, evaluate new opportunities, and allocate resources with confidence. You'll help transform data from a byproduct of our operations into a strategic asset that guides the future of GitLab.</p>\n<h2>What you'll do</h2>\n<ul>\n<li value=\"1\">Partner directly with the CFO, VP Finance, and FP&amp;A team to deliver high-impact analytical insights that inform strategic financial and business decisions.</li>\n<li value=\"2\">Design and execute sophisticated analytical frameworks to evaluate GitLab's financial performance, unit economics, market opportunities, and strategic options.</li>\n<li value=\"3\">Translate complex financial, operational, and statistical analyses into clear, concise, and actionable recommendations for executive audiences, especially finance leaders.</li>\n<li value=\"4\">Develop, maintain, and continuously improve executive-level dashboards and reporting that provide real-time visibility into key financial metrics, strategic KPIs, and business trends.</li>\n<li value=\"5\">Lead and develop a team of 3 direct reports, owning end-to-end delivery of high-priority analytics projects while remaining deeply hands-on with analysis, modeling, and visualization.</li>\n<li value=\"6\">Collaborate cross-functionally with central data, finance, product, marketing, sales, and engineering teams to connect data from multiple sources and deliver integrated, company-wide insights.</li>\n<li value=\"7\">Build strong, trusted relationships with C-level executives and senior leaders by anticipating information needs, proactively surfacing insights, and following through on commitments.</li>\n<li value=\"8\">Present analytical findings and strategic recommendations with clarity and impact, tailoring your communication style to non-technical executive stakeholders and cross-functional partners.</li>\n<li value=\"9\">Help shape best practices for how GitLab uses SQL, statistical analysis, and data visualization tools to understand performance, identify trends, and support data-driven financial decision making.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What you'll bring</h2>\n<ul>\n<li value=\"1\">Extensive experience in management consulting, investment banking, analytics, data science, or similar fields, with a focus on solving complex business problems and supporting senior finance leaders.</li>\n<li value=\"2\">Expert-level proficiency in SQL, statistical analysis, and data visualization tools (we use Tableau), along with experience working with modern data platforms and tools (we use Snowflake, dbt, GitLab, and others).</li>\n<li value=\"3\">Proven ability to design, execute, and operationalize analytical frameworks that inform C-level decision making, measure business performance, and support strategic financial planning.</li>\n<li value=\"4\">Exceptional communication and data storytelling skills, including the ability to translate complex analytical findings into clear, concise, and actionable recommendations for non-technical stakeholders.</li>\n<li value=\"5\">A track record of building and maintaining strong relationships with C-level leaders and cross-functional partners across central data, finance, product, marketing, sales, and engineering.</li>\n<li value=\"6\">Experience leading and developing high-performing analytics teams, including providing coaching, feedback, and mentorship while remaining hands-on with analysis and problem solving.</li>\n<li value=\"7\">Familiarity with the metrics and dynamics that drive SaaS, technology, and other high-growth businesses, and how they inform financial and strategic decisions.</li>\n<li value=\"8\">Experience working in distributed or remote environments, or collaborating with teams across different regions and time zones.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>About the team</h2>\n<p>Our Business Analytics and Insights function is building the analytical foundation that helps GitLab make faster, better decisions at scale. The team focuses on high-impact, company-wide questions, from evaluating new growth opportunities to assessing performance across products, segments, and markets.</p>\n<p>The team works closely with partners in central data, finance, product, marketing, sales, and engineering to connect data from multiple sources and keep our metrics, reporting, and insights consistent across the business. We use a modern data stack (including SQL, Snowflake, dbt, Tableau, GitLab, and other tools) and are always looking for better ways to understand performance and identify trends.</p>\n<p>You'll join a distributed, async-first team that tackles some of the most interesting challenges in a high-growth SaaS environment, such as separating signal from noise in a rapidly evolving market and quantifying the impact of strategic options. We rely heavily on written communication and clear documentation so our work scales across time zones and functions, and we care deeply about using data to shape how GitLab runs the business and makes decisions at the highest level.</p></div><div class=\"job__pay-ranges\"><div class=\"pay-range\"><div class=\"description\"><div class=\"body\"><span><p><em>The base salary range for this role\u2019s listed level is currently for residents of the&nbsp;United States only.

Co-create the future with us as we build technology that transforms how the world develops software. An overview of this role You'll serve as the senior analytics partner to GitLab's finance and executive teams, shaping how data informs our most important strategic decisions. Today, insights live in many places and leaders often have to stitch together views of performance, markets, and risk on their own. You'll change this by building clear, executive-ready analytics that connect operational data to business outcomes and long-term strategy. Your focus will be on designing sophisticated analytical frameworks, elevating how we measure the business, and turning complex data into simple, actionable recommendations for our CFO, VP Finance, FP&A team, and other senior leaders. You'll report to the VP Finance and operate as a team leader, building and leading a small, high-performing Business Analytics & Insights team while staying hands-on across SQL, statistical analysis, and data visualization. In your first year, you'll establish the core set of executive dashboards, strategic KPIs, and analytic tools that GitLab's leadership will rely on to run the company, evaluate new opportunities, and allocate resources with confidence.

Collaborate cross-functionally with central data, finance, product, marketing, sales, and engineering teams to connect data from multiple sources and deliver integrated, company-wide insights. Build strong, trusted relationships with C-level executives and senior leaders by anticipating information needs, proactively surfacing insights, and following through on commitments. Present analytical findings and strategic recommendations with clarity and impact, tailoring your communication style to non-technical executive stakeholders and cross-functional partners. Help shape best practices for how GitLab uses SQL, statistical analysis, and data visualization tools to understand performance, identify trends, and support data-driven financial decision making. What you'll bring Extensive experience in management consulting, investment banking, analytics, data science, or similar fields, with a focus on solving complex business problems and supporting senior finance leaders.
